This project aims to explore the evolution of peopleâ€™s music preference under the influence of a recommendation system. By analyzing historical data and simulating user interaction with the system, I attempt to answer the following questions: if we listen to songs recommended to us by a recommendation system, how will our taste in music change over time? Will we eventually be stuck in a filter bubble listening to songs that are all similar? Or will our taste in music develop into something completely different from before?
